# 🌍 StrategyGame

**StrategyGame** is an innovative real-time strategy game where the game map is generated using **real-world geographical data** and rendered using a **hexagonal tile system**. Players explore, collect resources from scattered chests, and engage in strategic decisions within a procedurally created world. The architecture includes a powerful server backend to handle data traffic and game logic.
