# Developer Guides

Tri6es is a long-running project that started in WS 2020/2021, continues in
WS 2021/2022, and will continue after this winter semester as well. This means
that every six months the group working on this project changes and this change
brings with it some loss of knowledge, which makes maintenance more difficult
in the long run.

We are now the fourth group working on this project and the third working on this 
branch (in SS 2021 two groups worked in parallel; their work was not merged), 
and we have already experienced some of the difficulties that come with 
understanding the thought processes and approaches of the previous groups. 

Our goal with these documents/guides is to preserve some of that knowledge for
future groups and improve overall maintainability. <br/>
We don't claim that everything in here is perfect or even correct for that matter,
so if you find any mistakes or think that something could be improved, feel free
to make adjustments.
